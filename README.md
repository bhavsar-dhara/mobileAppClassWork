Mobile App Class Work - [Spring 2016 Course WebPage](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/intille/teaching/MAD16S/MobileApplicationDevelopment2016S.htm)

The odd numbered assignments and the project coded and implemented are in this repository.

The project app, named **"Eat Slowly Trainer"**, is designed for an Android Wear to ensure the user eats slowly which will assist in weight reduction.

Initially the app would measure the interval time between the bites and then increase that time by 15% and then would buzz/vibrate when the user takes another bite within the interval time.

Hence trying to maintain the user's interval time between bites as per the calculated interval time.
